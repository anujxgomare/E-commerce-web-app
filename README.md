🛒 E-Commerce Web Application

A modular Spring Boot–based shopping platform with product management, search, cart, and checkout features.

This E-Commerce Web Application is a full-stack project built using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate/JPA, and MySQL, designed to replicate the core features of a modern online shopping system. It offers an end-to-end shopping experience — from browsing products to checkout — while maintaining a clean, scalable, and backend-centric architecture.

The project is ideal for understanding real-world backend workflows, MVC layering, relational database integration, and practical CRUD operations within an e-commerce context.

🚀 Key Features

✔ Home Page with All Products — Dynamic product listing with details ✔ Add New Product — Includes name, price, description, and image upload ✔ Product Search — Search by product name or category ✔ Cart System — Add items, remove items, update quantity ✔ Checkout Flow — Review cart items and complete the purchase ✔ Modular Architecture — Controller, Service, Repository, Entity layers ✔ MySQL Integration — Persistent storage of products, carts, and orders ✔ Hibernate/JPA — Automated ORM without SQL queries ✔ Clean Codebase — Beginner-friendly and production-style structure

🧱 Tech Stack

Java

Spring Boot

Spring MVC

Spring Data JPA / Hibernate

MySQL

Thymeleaf (optional UI)

Maven

🧩 Architecture Overview Controller → Service → Repository → Entity → MySQL

Controller: Handles HTTP requests

Service: Business logic and flow control

Repository: CRUD operations via JPA

Entity: Maps data to database tables

MySQL: Stores product + cart + order data

🔍 Why This Project Stands Out

Real-world e-commerce workflows

Clear demonstration of layered architecture

Practical CRUD + search + cart functionality

Great portfolio project for backend developer roles

Shows mastery of Spring Boot fundamentals

🚧 Possible Future Enhancements

✨ User authentication (Spring Security) ✨ Order history page ✨ Payment gateway integration ✨ Pagination + sorting ✨ Microservices version
